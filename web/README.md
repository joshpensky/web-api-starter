## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Follow the installation instructions in the [root directory](../README.md#installation) and you're done!

## ðŸ›  Development Workflow

1. Run `nvm use` to ensure you're using the correct version of Node

2. Run `npm start` to start up the web development server

   You should now be able to visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser for the web app and begin development!

   _**Note:** if at any time you would like to cancel the running server instance, press `CTRL + C` in the open terminal window._

## ðŸ™… Code Quality

Don't commit messy code!

Here's a list of things already configured to keep you in line:

- [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/)
- [Upstatement's ESLint Config](https://github.com/Upstatement/eslint-config)
- [Upstatement's Prettier Config](https://github.com/Upstatement/prettier-config)

All of these tools will be run with the pre-commit hook (configured with [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky)) to make sure you're not committing inconsistent code. We highly recommend configuring your editor to use these tools so that you can see (and fix) style violations as you write code.
